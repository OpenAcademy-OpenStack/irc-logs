02:05:27 <subbu_allamaraju> The agenda today is to review https://github.com/OpenAcademy-OpenStack/project-docs/blob/master/projects.md
02:05:52 <subbu_allamaraju> We have dading, thuc and myself from eBay
02:06:13 <subbu_allamaraju> I've setup a google doc to note project preferences - https://docs.google.com/a/subbu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApntcBgpHeZldHhaaTI1V2NBb0JqbUZSWkZJS3dFV1E&usp=drive_web#gid=0
02:06:25 <subbu_allamaraju> This is to record first and second preferences
02:06:35 <Srinivasan> sorry, wifi issues.
02:06:39 <subbu_allamaraju> np
02:06:53 <subbu_allamaraju> Before we get started, any other topics on the agenda?
02:07:07 <subbu_allamaraju> Any feedback from devstack experience so far?
02:07:09 <vishwa> hi subbu, I don't think we have write preferences on the google doc
02:07:34 <subbu_allamaraju> vishwa: fixed
02:08:08 <subbu_allamaraju> If no other items on the agenda we can get started
02:08:57 <gluong> I was wondering if there will be any starter/good-first-bugs to work on
02:09:02 <gluong> prior to the project start
02:09:27 <subbu_allamaraju> Would another group exercise help?
02:09:36 <theocean154> yep
02:09:54 <theocean154> also as people get questions, email all the google group
02:09:59 <subbu_allamaraju> I think thuc has one ready.
02:10:23 <vishwa> yea I agree, another exercise would be great to get more familiarized
02:10:30 <thuc> I added one https://github.com/OpenAcademy-OpenStack/project-docs/blob/master/exercises/instance_connectivity_check.md
02:10:33 <gluong> I think it would be good to dive further into the codebase and push some code if the time permits
02:11:43 <subbu_allamaraju> How about this - once we discuss the projects, and we have a general consensus on who would like to work on what, we can tweak the exercise to be in that area. OpenStack is very large.
