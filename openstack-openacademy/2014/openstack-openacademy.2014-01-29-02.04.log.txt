02:04:51 <subbu_allamaraju> #startmeeting weekly-syncup
02:04:51 <gluong> re-ran ./stack.sh and that seemed to start up keystone
02:04:52 <osoabot> Meeting started Wed Jan 29 02:04:51 2014 UTC.  The chair is subbu_allamaraju. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.

02:05:27 <subbu_allamaraju> The agenda today is to review https://github.com/OpenAcademy-OpenStack/project-docs/blob/master/projects.md
02:05:52 <subbu_allamaraju> We have dading, thuc and myself from eBay
02:06:13 <subbu_allamaraju> I've setup a google doc to note project preferences - https://docs.google.com/a/subbu.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApntcBgpHeZldHhaaTI1V2NBb0JqbUZSWkZJS3dFV1E&usp=drive_web#gid=0
02:06:25 <subbu_allamaraju> This is to record first and second preferences
02:06:35 <Srinivasan> sorry, wifi issues.
02:06:39 <subbu_allamaraju> np
02:06:53 <subbu_allamaraju> Before we get started, any other topics on the agenda?
02:07:07 <subbu_allamaraju> Any feedback from devstack experience so far?
02:07:09 <vishwa> hi subbu, I don't think we have write preferences on the google doc
02:07:34 <subbu_allamaraju> vishwa: fixed
02:08:08 <subbu_allamaraju> If no other items on the agenda we can get started
02:08:57 <gluong> I was wondering if there will be any starter/good-first-bugs to work on
02:09:02 <gluong> prior to the project start
02:09:27 <subbu_allamaraju> Would another group exercise help?
02:09:36 <theocean154> yep
02:09:54 <theocean154> also as people get questions, email all the google group
02:09:59 <subbu_allamaraju> I think thuc has one ready.
02:10:23 <vishwa> yea I agree, another exercise would be great to get more familiarized
02:10:30 <thuc> I added one https://github.com/OpenAcademy-OpenStack/project-docs/blob/master/exercises/instance_connectivity_check.md
02:10:33 <gluong> I think it would be good to dive further into the codebase and push some code if the time permits
02:11:43 <subbu_allamaraju> How about this - once we discuss the projects, and we have a general consensus on who would like to work on what, we can tweak the exercise to be in that area. OpenStack is very large.
02:12:21 <Yu> I agree
02:12:33 <gluong> sounds good
02:12:42 <subbu_allamaraju> Great
02:12:53 <subbu_allamaraju> Let's go project by project
02:13:11 <subbu_allamaraju> First is to introduce two factor auth.
02:14:10 <subbu_allamaraju> As you saw in the first exercise, users have to include their crendentials in scripts/code to talk to OpenStack APIs.
02:15:08 <subbu_allamaraju> This may be okay in some cases, but there is a chance of leaking. Recently someone put his AWS credentials in a script and accidentally leaked it. Someone else abused the credentials. He noticed that and revoked the credentials since those were temporary.
02:15:13 <subbu_allamaraju> In OpenStack there is no equivalent.
02:15:35 <subbu_allamaraju> There are also situations where policies dictate that credentials should not be stored like that.
02:15:49 <subbu_allamaraju> That's the general idea.
02:16:49 <deen> hello everybody
02:16:54 <subbu_allamaraju> Hi deen
02:17:05 <deen> Hey Subbu.
02:17:13 <subbu_allamaraju> We are just discussing the projects. Started with the first one on https://github.com/OpenAcademy-OpenStack/project-docs/blob/master/projects.md
02:17:51 <Srinivasan> as for the actual code generation part
02:17:52 <deen> There are some people on the channel #OpenAcademy-OpenStack
02:17:57 <subbu_allamaraju> The work in this area involves changes to keystone, horizon (UI), UI etc
02:18:10 <subbu_allamaraju> Srinivasan: I included a python example
02:18:44 <subbu_allamaraju> For example, http://throwingfire.com/you-can-be-a-twofactor-hero/ shows how to mint a token, show a qr code to the user in a browser, and register with the Google Authenticator app
02:19:08 <Srinivasan> okay, got t.
02:19:10 <deen> Ok.
02:19:14 <subbu_allamaraju> As part of the design process we will have to decide what goes into the token
02:20:14 <subbu_allamaraju> There was a blueprint in OpenStack. We will resurrect it, and try to submit code to OpenStack.
02:20:45 <subbu_allamaraju> So it is important to polish the code and maintain the same conventions, unit tests etc.
02:20:55 <subbu_allamaraju> any other questions on this project?
02:21:40 <atheendra> Is there any reason for choosing this method over others?
02:21:48 <subbu_allamaraju> such as?
02:22:23 <atheendra> Like a key within the user space which does not require the use of a username/password at all?
02:23:08 <subbu_allamaraju> Sure. We can discuss alternatives.
02:23:42 <atheendra> OK, sounds good.
02:23:43 <subbu_allamaraju> I also encourage you try how two factor auth works on google, AWS etc
02:24:03 <subbu_allamaraju> The next one is Access Keys.
02:24:41 <subbu_allamaraju> This is in the same problem domain.
02:25:10 <subbu_allamaraju> BTW - just noticed In the above I mixed up the credential store use case in the first project.
02:25:27 <subbu_allamaraju> Please ignore that. Access keys is there to avoid storing shared credentails
02:25:31 <vishwa> yes subbu I was confused :)
02:25:39 <subbu_allamaraju> me too :)
02:25:49 <subbu_allamaraju> Sorry about that
02:25:57 <subbu_allamaraju> long day
